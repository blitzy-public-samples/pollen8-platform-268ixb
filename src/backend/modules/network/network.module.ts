@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Network]),
    UserModule, // Import UserModule to use UserService in NetworkService
  ],
  providers: [

```

This `NetworkModule` file defines the module structure for the network-related functionality in the Pollen8 backend application. Let's break down the key components:

1. We import necessary decorators and modules from NestJS and TypeORM.

2. We import our custom `NetworkService`, `NetworkController`, `NetworkRepository`, and `Network` entity.

3. We also import the `UserModule`, which is required because `NetworkService` depends on `UserService`.

4. The `@Module` decorator is used to define the module structure:

   - `imports`: We use `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Network])` to register the `Network` entity with TypeORM for this module. We also import `UserModule` to make `UserService` available.
   
   - `providers`: We register `NetworkService` and `NetworkRepository` as providers. These will be instantiated by NestJS and can be injected into other classes within this module.
   
   - `controllers`: We register `NetworkController`, which will handle HTTP requests related to network operations.
   
   - `exports`: We export `NetworkService`, making it available for use in other modules that import `NetworkModule`.

5. The class is named `NetworkModule`, following the NestJS naming convention for modules.

This module structure ensures that all network-related components are encapsulated and can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application. It addresses the requirements for network management and network value calculation by providing the necessary services and controllers.

The module is designed to be scalable and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of new network-related features in the future. It also follows the dependency injection pattern, making it easier to test and modify individual components.
