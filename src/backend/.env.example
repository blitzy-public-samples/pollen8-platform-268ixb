# Note: This is an example configuration file. Do not store sensitive information here.
# In production, use a secure method to manage environment variables and secrets.

# Security Notes:
# 1. Keep this file out of version control.
# 2. Use different values for different environments (development, staging, production).
# 3. Regularly rotate secrets and update them in your deployment environments.
# 4. In production, consider using a secrets management service instead of a .env file.

# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to `.env` in your local development environment.
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.
# 3. Ensure that the `.env` file is listed in your .gitignore to prevent accidental commits.
# 4. Use these environment variables in your application's configuration modules.
