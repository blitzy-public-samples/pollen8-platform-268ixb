/**
 * This file serves as the entry point for the Layout components in the Pollen8 platform's frontend.
 * It exports the main layout components to be used across the application, ensuring a consistent structure and easy imports for other parts of the frontend.
 *
 * Requirements addressed:
 * 1. Visual Network Management
 *    Location: Technical specification/1.1 System Objectives
 *    Description: Offer intuitive network visualization and management
 * 2. Consistent Layout
 *    Location: Technical specification/1.2 Scope/Product Overview
 *    Description: Provide a consistent layout across all pages

import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Sidebar from './Sidebar';

// Export the layout components
export { Header, Footer, Sidebar };

// Default export as an object containing all layout components
export default {
  Header,
  Footer,
  Sidebar,
};

/**
 * Additional implementation details:
 * - Uses ES6 module syntax for exporting components
 * - Leverages default exports from each component file
 * - Centralizes exports to support the 'barrel' pattern
 * - Simplifies imports in other parts of the application
 * - Maintains consistent black and white aesthetic (implemented in individual components)
 * - Ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes (implemented in individual components)
 * - Adheres to accessibility standards (implemented in individual components)
 * - Allows for easy addition of new layout components
 * 
 * Note: Corresponding test files should be created for each component in the appropriate test directory.
