// This file serves as the main export point for all reusable UI components
// in the Pollen8 platform's frontend. It centralizes the imports and exports
// of various UI components, making it easier to import and use these components
// throughout the application.

// Requirement: Modular UI Components
// Location: Technical specification/1.1 System Objectives/Visual Network Management
// Description: Provide a centralized export for reusable UI components

// Requirement: Consistent Design
// Location: Technical specification/1.2 Scope/Product Overview
// Description: Ensure consistent use of UI components across the application

// Import UI components
export { Button } from './Button';
export { Input } from './Input';
export { Modal } from './Modal';
export { Loader } from './Loader';
export { Toast } from './Toast';

// Note: All exported components adhere to the black and white minimalist design
// aesthetic specified in the technical requirements.

// Future UI components should be added to this file to maintain consistency
// in how components are imported and used across the application.

// This approach follows the best practice of encapsulating implementation details
// and providing a clean API for UI components.

// The components exported here are designed to be reusable, accessible,
// and consistent with the overall Pollen8 platform design.

// By centralizing exports, it becomes easier to manage and maintain UI components
// as the application grows.

// This structure allows for easier refactoring and component updates without
// affecting import statements throughout the codebase.

// The file adheres to the TypeScript module system, enabling type checking
// and autocompletion when importing these components in other files.
