/**
 * App Component
 * 
 * This is the main component that sets up the application structure.
 * It provides the global context providers and routing configuration.
 * 
 * Requirements addressed:
 * 1. Frontend Architecture (Technical specification/2.3.1 Frontend Components)
 *    Description: Implement the main structure of the React application
 * 2. Global State Management (Technical specification/2.3.1 Frontend Components)
 *    Description: Set up context providers for authentication and theming
 * 3. Routing Configuration (Technical specification/1.1 System Objectives/Visual Network Management)
 *    Description: Integrate the routing system for the application

/**
 * Implementation details:
 * 
 * 1. BrowserRouter: Wraps the entire application to enable routing functionality.
 * 
 * 2. ThemeProvider: Provides global theme context for consistent styling across the app.
 *    It should be implemented to allow for the black and white aesthetic as per the technical specification.
 * 
 * 3. AuthProvider: Manages global authentication state, allowing components to access
 *    and modify the user's authentication status.
 * 
 * 4. AppRoutes: Contains the main routing configuration for the application,
 *    defining the structure and flow of the user interface.
 * 
 * Note: This component doesn't contain any direct UI elements. Its primary purpose
 * is to set up the application's foundational structure and provide global contexts.
 * 
 * Performance considerations:
 * - The use of context providers allows for efficient prop drilling and state management.
 * - The routing configuration is separated into its own component (AppRoutes) for better
 *   code organization and potential code-splitting opportunities.
 * 
 * Accessibility:
 * - Ensure that the ThemeProvider implements color schemes that meet WCAG contrast guidelines.
 * 
 * Security:
 * - The AuthProvider should implement secure methods for managing user authentication,
 *   including token storage and renewal strategies.
 * 
 * Future enhancements:
 * - Consider implementing a ErrorBoundary component at this level to catch and handle
 *   any unhandled errors in the component tree.
 * - If internationalization is required in the future, an I18nProvider could be added here.
